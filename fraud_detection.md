Credit Card Fraud is a widespread problem in the 21st century. Credit card fraud is when someone other than a customer with their name on a credit card authorizes the credit card to purchase something at a business. Often, consumers are protected by their credit card company against fraud, so not only is the customer impacted, but so is the financial institution. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the company to be able to detect fraud in real-time and decline fraudulent transactions, stopping the person fraudulently using the credit card from making purchases. However, this is tricky, as false positives – identifying purchases as fraudulent that are not – can be both frustrating and embarrassing for the consumer, however false negatives can cost both consumers and financial institutions millions of dollars per year.  In this analysis I used logistic regression and a random forest model to classify transactions as fraudulent or not and ended classifying transactions with a 98.1% accuracy.
